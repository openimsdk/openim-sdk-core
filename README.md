The "openim-sdk-core" is an IM SDK designed to work in conjunction with the "open-im-server", intended for embedding in client-side applications.
It includes local storage, listener callbacks, API wrappers, and connection management, ensuring real-time and completeness of messages.
The "openim-sdk-core" is implemented in Golang and utilizes "gomobile" for cross-platform compilation on mobile devices.

## üß© Awesome features

OpenIM-SDK-core is a core SDK of OpenIM. 

1. Manage WebSocket long connections, responsible for creating, closing and reconnecting connections. 
2. Encoding and decoding. Encode and decode messages in binary format to achieve cross-language compatibility.
3. Implement basic protocols of OpenIM, such as login, push, etc. 
4. Provide an event handling mechanism to convert received messages into corresponding events and pass them to upper layer applications for processing.
5. Cache management. Manage user, group, blacklists, and other cache information. 
6. Provide basic IM function APIs such as sending messages, creating groups, etc. Hide the underlying implementation details from the upper layer application.
